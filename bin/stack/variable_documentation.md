# Stroom Environment Variable Documentation

The following environment variables are used to configure the stroom stacks.

This file is also used as a source for adding in-line documentation to the
`.env` file in the stack configuration (see create_stack_env.sh). For the
documentation to be included, the environment variable name must appear as a
second level heading, i.e. `## ENV_VAR_NAME`. All non-blank lines after that
will be included as documentation for that environment variable.

Variables should be listed in A-Z order. Text should have hard breaks before 80
chars.
