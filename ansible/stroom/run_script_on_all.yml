# Ideally we would be able to run a script on the 'all' host_group by

# You can't loop these because we need to vary the hosts which can only be done at
# the play level. And you can't loop plays.

# Use this to execute operations on host_groups. E.g.
#   ansible-playbook -i hosts stack_op.yml --extra-vars "op=restart"
