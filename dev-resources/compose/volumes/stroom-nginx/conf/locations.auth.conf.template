# TODO: We don't really want this path. Auth has several responsibilities.
# Some of them are mapped to more helpful locations, as above, but really 
# should be non-root. E.g. passwordReset is root, so we need this location.

# The following routes mount stroom-ui onto this server. These paths catch
# everything that should go to the UI.

# This allows stroom-ui to get its config.

# This allows stroom-ui to get its fav icon.
location /favicon.ico {
    proxy_pass https://auth_ui_upstream/favicon.ico;

# This allows stroom-ui to get its manifest.
location /manifest.json {
    proxy_pass https://auth_ui_upstream/manifest.json;

# This allows stroom-ui to get its assets, e.g. css and images.

# This is the path where all non-chrome pages are hosted,
# i.e. all the normal functionality but without the chrome (navigation, footer).
