# The access logs need to mirror the standard nginx/apache 'combined' format
# but using the subject DN instead of the remote_user. 'logname' doesn't appear
# to be a thing in nginx, so have hard-coded it to '-'.

#Standard Apache Format 
#%h - host name should be ok without quotes
#%l - Remote logname (from identd, if supplied). This will return a dash unless IdentityCheck is set On.
#\"%u\" - user name should be quoted to deal with DNs
#%t - time is added in square brackets so is contained for parsing purposes
#\"%r\" - URL is quoted
#%>s - Response code doesn't need to be quoted as it is a single number
#%b - The size in bytes of the response sent to the client
#\"%{Referer}i\" - Referrer is quoted so that's ok
#\"%{User-Agent}i\" - User agent is quoted so also ok
#
#LogFormat "%h %l \"%u\" %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
